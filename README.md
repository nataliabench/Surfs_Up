# Surfs Up - Waves and Ice Cream

## Overview of the Analysis
We will conduct analysis on a weather dataset from Oahu, Haiwaii to determine if deciding to open a new business venture would be a viable option.  This is an important factor one must consider when propsoing a new business idea, especially for a venture involved a shop selling surf boards and ice cream to locals and tourists in Oahu.  Since sunny weather is required for the highest outcome of visitors to visit the shop, considering this analysis is crucial on the decision.

We used the haiwaii.sqlite as our data source with Python languaging, Pandas library, Jupyter Notebook.  We also used the applications SQLite and SQLAlchemy to deliver results.

## Results
* The average temperature in June is 74.9 compared to December which is 71.0.  (low variance)
* The data could've been skewed due to June having more data points of 1,700 compared to December which had 1,517 data points.
* There was a larger difference between the lowest marked temperatures in both months compared to the difference between the highest temperatures which was of 2 degrees difference.  

## Summary
Results showed that temperatures ranging between 75 and 77 degrees occured the most often in Oahu, Haiwaii.

This significes that the summer must be longer than the winter or that more days throughout the year tend to be on the warmer side which is a good sign for this specific business venture.  I do believe that deeper analysis must be done in order to truly determine what causes the fluxuations in temperature and if when the temperature does drop, we must determine how that could affect the opening of "Waves and Ice Cream" year round.
